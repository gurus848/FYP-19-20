    "# Testing FewRel few-shot relation extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "* goal is to make it like the demo at http://opennre.thunlp.ai/#/fewshot_re - in the demo it seems to work pretty well\n",
    "* based on https://github.com/thunlp/FewRel\n",
    "* use torch 1.3.1\n",
    "* copy val_wiki.json as test_wiki.json in the data folder to make it work\n",
    "* python requirements same as opennre\n",
    "* the checkpoint files are very big, so they aren't in the repository. One checkpoint is at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yiz3q3xNz-llsY55g5OdodxiH1RThYuz/view?usp=sharing\n",
    "* can't train on prof song's gpus, not enough vram. the hpc computers have enough vram, but i couldn't get pytorch to work on them, it uses a 10 year old version of linux.... \n",
    "* however testing using this code does actually work on the gpu (but you would need to use cuda pytorch (refer to pytorch.org) and whereever you are using model do \"model = model.cuda()\", and also \"tensor=tensor.cuda()\"). refer to test_script.py\n",
    "* on my laptop cpu this code takes about 2 seconds per query, on the gpu it's a lot faster, runs in under 1 second. the speed seems fine, but more testing is required to really find out. \n",
    "* i noticed that after a lot of training the model seems to overfit, so it doesn't work properly on the testing data. therefore we should probably make our own benchmark in order to compare different models to each other. \n",
    "* the maximum length is in terms of the number of bert tokens, not in terms of the number of characters in the sentence. increasing it seems to work fine\n"
