We will continue to lead the global coalition to degrade and defeat Da’esh so that it can no longer brutalize those who reject its tormented worldview.

We also call for an end to the Asad regime’s escalating attacks on Aleppo and Daraya, as well as its besiegement of towns and obstruction of humanitarian access. These actions demonstrate a disregard for the Cessation of Hostilities, UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and efforts to advance a political solution to the conflict, as well as its own commitments to facilitate full access for humanitarian relief supplies. Secretary Kerry raised these concerns in a call with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov earlier today and urged him to press the regime to cease at once airstrikes against opposition forces and innocent civilians in Aleppo and the Damascus suburbs. Russia has a special responsibility in this regard to press the regime to end its offensive attacks and strikes that kill civilians, immediately allow relief supplies, as determined solely by the UN, to reach all in need, and to comply completely with the Cessation of Hostilities, so that political talks aimed at ending the crisis have a chance to succeed. Such a solution will allow all parties to focus on the shared threat posed by Da’esh and other terrorists." }
