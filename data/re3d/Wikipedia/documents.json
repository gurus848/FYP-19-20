He hails from Amarah, a city in Southern Iraq.\nQanbar was a commander in the navy during Saddam Hussein's reign, and took part in the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-88, and the war over Kuwait in 1990-91. In the latter, he commanded a garrison on the Kuwaiti island of Failaka, and was taken prisoner by U.S. Marines. He was a brigadier general in the navy during the 1991 Gulf War. After being captured in Fialaka, he was briefly transferred to Saudi Arabia before his release. Despite being captured by American forces, Qanbar was later decorated by Saddam for his bravery in defense of the island.[2] After the war, Qanbar was posted in Basra, but was excluded from new commands after he refused to stop the 1991 Shiite uprising.[1]\nHe was appointed by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to lead the 2007 Baghdad crackdown in February 2007, though he was considered a relatively unknown officer.[3] Qanbar was a compromise choice after the U.S. military rejected Maliki's first choice, Mohan al-Freiji.[2] Qanbar announced the details of the new security plan on live Iraqi television on February 13.[4]\n" }

The main purpose of the dam is to divert floodwater in the Tigris River to Lake Tharthar through the Tharthar depression along with irrigation and an 84 MW hydro-electricity station. It also serves to produce hydroelectric power and flood control – although the later has become less critical with the construction of the Mosul Dam upstream and several other large dams in Turkey.\nIt was completed in 1956 by the German company Züblin. Designs were completed by the British firm Voganlei and Coode. The power station was commissioned in 1972. The Samarra Barrage portion of the structure has 17 gates capable of passing 7,000 m3/s (247,203 cu ft/s) of water to the Tigris while the Tharthar regulator can divert up to 9,000 m3/s (317,832 cu ft/s) into a canal with 36 gates. The reservoir's design capacity is 150,000,000 m3 (121,607 acre·ft) but much of that is filled with sediment.[1][2]\nThe intent was to use water stored from the Samarra Barrage and the Ramadi Barrage for irrigation. However, evaporation on Lakes Habbaniyah and Tharthar lead to reduces storage and high salinity; conditions unsuitable for irrigation.[3]\nIn April 2015 the Tharthar Barrage was captured by The Islamic State after several days of fighting that saw 120 Iraqi soldiers and a senior Iraqi general killed. The jihadist group also took over a nearby military barracks during the battle.[4]\n" }

The operation was important in that it was the first large scale deployment of the New Iraqi Army. This offensive was part of the larger Operation Sayeed (Hunter), designed to prevent al Qaeda in Iraq from operating in the Euphrates River Valley and throughout Al Anbar and to establish a permanent Iraqi Army presence in the Al Qa’im region.\n\"On 5 November, Marines from 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines and 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines began their assault on insurgent-held Karabilah, and had cleared the city four days later. Then on 10 November the coalition forces began to attack the city of Husaybah and pursue any insurgents who fled Karabilah. After four more days of fighting in Husaybah, the coalition troops launched another phase of the operation into the city of Ubaydi, an insurgent haven and site of the earlier Operation Matador. The fortified city fell to coalition forces after seven days of fighting, bringing a conclusion to Operation Steel Curtain. The assault on Sadah and a small portion of Karabilah was known as \"\"Operation: Iron Fist\"\". The assault of Husaybah and Karabilah was \"\"Operation: Steel Curtain\"\". So named because the resident leader of anti-coalition forces, al-Zarqawi, said they would hold on to Husaybah with an \"\"iron fist\"\". Named by Coalition Commanders, \"\"Operation Steel Curtain\"\", was a hardened sweep and clear mission hence \"\"steel curtain\"\" because one of the SNCOs was a Pittsburgh Steelers fan.\"\nU.S. officials reported that the operation killed 139 insurgents and took 256 more prisoners, and considered it successful. Battle positions were constructed, preventing the insurgency from regaining control of the city. At least 10 U.S. Marines and an unknown number of Iraqi soldiers died.[3][4][5] A local physician from Husaybah, Zahid Mohammed Rawi, said that medical workers had counted 97 civilians killed in the first week of the operation.[2]\n" }
