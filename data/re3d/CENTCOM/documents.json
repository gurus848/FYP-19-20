To clarify: U.S. forces are advising and assisting Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), primarily Syrian Arab forces operating in the northern part of the country who are leading efforts in the campaign to defeat Daesh.\n\nGen. Joseph Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command said, \"We've been very clear from the outset of this campaign that to defeat Daesh we would need to work with many different elements operating on the ground in Iraq and Syria. In Syria, with the support of the 60-plus nation Counter-Daesh Coalition, the SDF, which includes the Syrian Arab Coalition, has made extraordinary progress over the past 20-plus months, retaking more than 18,000 square kilometers of territory previously held by the enemy. We will continue to support their efforts specific to the fight against Daesh. At the same time, we are enormously grateful for the tremendous support provided by our Coalition partners, especially the Turks. They remain integral to the accomplishment of our common objective which is the ultimate defeat of Daesh in Iraq and Syria.\"" }

Lorraine Walsh, an artillery crewmember and native of Vermillion, South Dakota. “Working with them was enjoyable; the Jordanians are extremely knowledgeable with their systems.” \n\nNoncommissioned officers from each unit were able to share knowledge from past experiences in an information exchange between subject matter experts.\nStaff Sgt. Albert Connelly, an artillery crew chief in Abel Battery, 3rd Battalion, said “we were able to give classes on the different systems we use in the machines.” The exercise showcased the continuing cooperation within the two nations.\n\n“Establishing, maintaining and enhancing interoperability with our coalition partners strengthens the global security framework, protects our common interests, deters conflict, and sets the conditions for future contingency operations,” said Russell. “We always look to build greater relationships with our partners.”" }

Many Arab citizens who have been liberated from villages around Raqqa are seeking to join the SDF’s fight against ISIL, Davis said.\nThe SDF have regained about 300 square miles since the isolation of Raqqa began early last month, Davis said.\nIn the past 24 hours, the U.S.-led coalition’s four airstrikes delivered 24 munitions against ISIL targets, which include three tactical units, a command-and-control node and five supply routes in support of SDF operations to isolate Raqqa, Davis said. The most recent airstrikes bring the total number of munitions in support of the SDF since Dec. 5 to 922, he added.\n" }

The exercise is intended to enhance mutual capabilities, improve tactical proficiency and strengthen partnerships in ensuring the free flow of commerce and freedom of navigation.\nNAVCENT is responsible for approximately 2.5 million square miles of area including the Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.

Travis Caughlin, 507th Maintenance Group Commander. “We’ve spent a long time training and preparing and it’s very worthwhile when you get to go execute what’s really going on. It doesn’t get any more real than this.”\n\nThe group plans to be deployed two months, which is shorter than previous deployments in Air Force Reserve Command. This realignment is partially designed to improve operations by keeping maintenance and operations teams together both during the deployment and when training at home station. \n\nWhile the deployment may be shorter, the 507th ARW will be deploying again with a large contingent of the wing deploying again in the summer of 2017. With operations in Southwest Asia continuing, support from the Air Reserve Component is vital according to wing leadership. \n\n“I’m convinced tankers are the key to global reach, “Caughlin said. “If we don’t get there, fighters, bombers, and airlifters won’t get there without the tanker. We’ve got to get that gas to the warfighter.”" }

In Syria, Coalition military forces conducted 15 strikes using attack, bomber, fighter and remotely piloted aircraft against ISIL targets. Additionally in Iraq, Coalition military forces conducted 11 strikes coordinated with and in support of the government of Iraq using attack, bomber, fighter, and remotely piloted aircraft as well as rocket artillery against ISIL targets.\nSyria\n. Near Ar Raqqah, 12 strikes engaged six ISIL tactical units; destroyed an IED, seven fighting positions, and a VBIED; and damaged four supply routes.\n. Near Ayn Isa, one strike destroyed a VBIED and an ISIL tactical vehicle.\n. Near Dayr Az Zayr, one strike destroyed an oil pump jack.\n. Near Palmyra, one strike destroyed two ISIL weapons caches.\nIraq\n. Near Al Huwayjah, one strike engaged an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed an ISIL-held building.\n. Near Mosul, seven strikes engaged four ISIL tactical units; destroyed a fighting position, a heavy machine gun, seven ISIL-held buildings, four VBIEDs, a VBIED facility, two weapons caches, three tactical vehicles, a tunnel entrance, and a mortar; damaged 18 supply routes; and suppressed two mortar teams and an ISIL tactical unit.\n. Near Tal Afar, three strikes destroyed an ISIL-held building and four UAV construction facilities.\nStrike assessments are based on initial reports. All aircraft returned to base safely.\nA strike, as defined in the CJTF releases, means one or more kinetic events that occur in roughly the same geographic location to produce a single, sometimes cumulative effect for that location.\nSo having a single aircraft deliver a single weapon against a lone ISIL vehicle is one strike, but so is multiple aircraft delivering dozens of weapons against a group of buildings and vehicles and weapon systems in a compound, for example, having the cumulative effect of making that facility (or facilities) harder or impossible to use.\nAccordingly, CJTF-OIR does not report the number or type of aircraft employed in a strike, the number of munitions dropped in each strike, or the number of individual munition impact points against a target. The information used to compile the daily strike releases is based on 'Z' or Greenwich Mean Time.\nGround-based artillery fired in counter-fire or in fire support to maneuver roles are not classified as a strike as defined by CJTF-OIR.\nThe strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria, and the wider international community.\nThe destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the group's ability to project terror and conduct operations. Coalition nations which have conducted strikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Coalition nations which have conducted strikes in Syria include Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n" }
