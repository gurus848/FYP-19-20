We have supported the liberation of key towns in Northern Iraq including Rabiyah and Zumar, broken the siege of the Yazidis on Mount Sinjar, and pushed ISIL out of Kobane.\n\nAs the second largest contributor to the Coalition military activities, the UK has flown over 870 missions, conducted over 265 bombing raids on ISIL targets, and is now providing an additional 125 soldiers to assist in Counter-IED training for the Iraqi Army helping them to clear territory safely and return it to local people.\n\nLast week, we also announced that we would increase our humanitarian support to Iraq by £20 million, bringing our total contribution to £59.5 million, supporting people across Iraq who have been forced to flee from ISIL’s brutality." }
