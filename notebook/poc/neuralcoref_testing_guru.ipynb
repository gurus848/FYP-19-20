       "'The returns Tuesday also amounted to a historic rebuke of the Democratic Party from the white blue-collar voters who had formed the party base from the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt to Mr. Clintons. Yet Mrs. Clinton and Clinton advisers had taken for granted that states like Michigan and Wisconsin would stick with a Democratic nominee, and that Clinton could repeat Mr. Obamas strategy of mobilizing the partys ascendant liberal coalition rather than pursuing a more moderate course like Clinton husband did 24 years ago. But not until these voters were offered a Republican who ran as an unapologetic populist, railing against foreign trade deals and illegal immigration, did these voters move so drastically away from these voters ancestral political home. To the surprise of many on the left, white voters who had helped elect the nations first black president, appeared more reluctant to line up behind a white woman. From Pennsylvania to Wisconsin, industrial towns once full of union voters who for decades offered their votes to Democratic presidential candidates, even in the partys lean years, shifted to Mr. Trumps Republican Party. One county in the Mahoning Valley of Ohio, Trumbull, went to Mr. Trump by a six-point margin. Four years ago, Mr. Trumps Republican Party won there by 22 points. Mrs. Clintons loss was especially crushing to millions who had cheered her march toward history as, millions who had cheered her march toward history hoped, the nations first female president. For supporters, the election often felt like a referendum on gender progress: an opportunity to elevate a woman to the nations top job and to repudiate a man whose remarkably boorish behavior toward women had assumed center stage during much of the campaign. Mr. Trump boasted, in a 2005 video released last month, about using Mr. Trump public profile to commit sexual assault. Mr. Trump suggested that female political rivals lacked a presidential look. Mr. Trump ranked women on a scale of one to 10, even holding forth on the desirability of Mr. Trump own daughter  the kind of throwback male behavior that many in the country assumed would disqualify a candidate for high office.'"
